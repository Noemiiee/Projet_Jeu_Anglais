        <div class="assurvivor">THE OBJECTIVE :</div> 
        <div class="intro">Dead by Daylight is an asymmetric multiplayer horror game in which one player takes on the role of a bloodthirsty killer while the other four play the survivors.
        As a killer, your goal is to sacrifice as many survivors as possible. As a survivor, your goal is to escape and avoid being captured and killed.</div>
        </br>
        </br>
        <div class="assurvivor">AS A SURVIVOR :</div>
        As a survivor, your main objective is to escape the map to survive. To do this, you must repair 5 generators that power 2 exit doors, while avoiding the killer.
        The survivors have no way to hurt the killer. To avoid being caught, they can crouch behind obstacles or hide in tall grass, dark corners or in lockers. Survivors should be careful when performing quick actions or making noise, as this may attract the attention of the killer.
        When the killer is close, you can hear a heartbeat. The closer the killer is to a survivor, the more intense this sound, called a terror ray, becomes. Survivors can see a red cone-shaped glow following the killer. This red spot indicates the direction in which the killer is looking.
        Survivors can save each other from the hooks to prevent a sacrifice from being made. Survivors can attempt to blind or stun the killer so that it will drop the survivor it is carrying. Each survivor can treat others in wounded or critical condition, with or without a first aid kit.
        The first step to escape is to repair the 5 generators spread across the map. Repairing takes time and makes noise, which can attract the killer. The killer can also see the exact position of all the generators. Survivors must therefore watch for the killer's movements and plan escape routes before starting repairs. Like many other survivor interactions, repairing a generator can trigger skill tests.
        A skill check is a time-based reflex action that requires you to hit a button at the right time or suffer the consequences. Missing a skill check alerts the killer with a loud warning and sets back the progress of the action. A beep sounds just before the skill check appears, to help the survivor anticipate the action.
        When the survivors manage to repair 5 generators, the exit doors are activated. Once opened, the exit allows the survivors to escape the map. The survivors decide when to leave the map. They can stay behind to help other survivors who have not yet made it out but need to escape before the Final Sprint.

        <div class="assurvivor">AS A KILLER : </div>
        The main objective of the killer is to satisfy the Entity by sacrificing survivors on available hooks on the map. The killer uses his unique powers and abilities to get as many sacrifices as possible and prevent the survivors from escaping.
        Killers have heightened senses that help them hunt for survivors:
        They can track temporary scuff marks left by fleeing survivors, track bloodstains left by injured or critically ill survivors, and they receive notifications of a survivor's location when they make noise.
        In a straight line, killers are faster, but survivors have more than one way to put objects and distance between themselves and the killer, such as jumping out of a window or over pallets. The killer's goal during a chase is to get within attack range to deliver a devastating blow to the survivor.
        All killers can launch two basic types of attacks: a quick, short-range attack and a charged, long-range attack. Whether or not the attacks are successful, they always trigger a recovery time. Hitting a survivor twice stuns them, allowing the killer to pick them up and carry them to a hook.
        The killer has a time limit on carrying survivors to a hook, as they may struggle to free themselves, stunning the killer in the process. The killer must also be careful of other survivors, as certain actions may force him to drop his precious cargo.
